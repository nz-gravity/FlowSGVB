# TODO

1. Compare LnL for my new likelihood and original
2. Run PE using original LnL and my new LnL --> do the posteriors match? Ask avi for help to overplot posteriors like in https://nrsur-catalog.github.io/NRSurCat-1/events/GW150914_095045.html
3. (future) Add in gibbs sampling ( first we estimate PSD with SGVB ad then we sample BBH params with JIM) these posteriors should match above


General TODOs
1. can we speed up analysis by "fixing" delta functions on some priors? IE only sample Masses + spins? 
2. What are the 'correct' JIM settings that we need?
3. How can I save posterior samples
4. Running on GPU+Ozstar/nesi (I think install is different)
